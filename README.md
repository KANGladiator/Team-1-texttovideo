# üé• AI Video Generator with Gradio Frontend

This repository contains a simple yet powerful notebook for generating AI-driven videos from text prompts using a Gradio interface. The project utilizes the **Diffusion Pipeline** from Hugging Face's `diffusers` library, providing a seamless way to create and visualize short videos based on user inputs.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Video Generation**: Input any creative text prompt, and the model generates a video based on your description.
- **Interactive Gradio Interface**: User-friendly interface for inputting prompts, generating videos, and downloading the output.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Videos are saved locally for easy access and reuse.
